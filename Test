1.ADDING ELEMENTS OF ARRAY UNTIL EVERY ELEMENT GREATER THAN EQUAL TO K

def min_operations(arr, k):
    operations = 0
    arr.sort()

    while arr[0] < k:
        if len(arr) < 2:
            return -1  # Not possible

        first = arr.pop(0)   # smallest
        second = arr.pop(0)  # second smallest
        arr.append(first + second)
        arr.sort()
        operations += 1

    return operations
arr = [1, 10, 12, 9, 2, 3]
k = 6
print(min_operations(arr, k))  # Output: 2
